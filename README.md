# Processing
These were my experiments with using Processing for Creative Coding and Generative Art, as a part of Sableraph's Weekly Creative Coding Challenge in early 2022.
I have mostly moved over to p5.js for this kind of work, where my projects are hosted on [OpenProcessing.org](https://openprocessing.org/user/327947).
